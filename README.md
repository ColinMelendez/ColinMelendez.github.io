Welcome to my simple personal site!

I believe in a light and minimalist approach - nothing indulgent, but not overly-manicured either.
The tech stack for this site (really just a page) is comprised of typescript, html, css, Vite (for dev and bundling), and pico css (for a highly content-focused authoring experience).

Maybe I'll build myself more of a portfolio one day - something to contain my *everything* - but for now, this is my "enough"
