        <p>
          Right now, I'm especially interested in learning about the infrastructure of deploying and scaling ML inference and training systems in the cloud and on-premise (read: my homelab ðŸ˜…) environments.

        <p>
          In my free time, I do a little carpentry, build silly esp32-based gadgets, and produce light shows for the local music scene (see: the silly esp32-based gadgets).

        <h4>Past Lives</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            This past spring I had the chance to dive deep into the design of computer vision models with professor Bolei Zhou.
          </li>
          <li>
            I worked with cherry pop records to build their volume 1 launch site, and did the technical production for their release concert.
          </li>
          <li>
            For a long time, I considered myself to primarily be a web/app developer, and all my professional experience up to now has been doing fullstack development in Javascript, or IOS development in Swift when I interned at Pullscription.
            While I feel my interests and focus now turing more towards system design, infrastructure, and operations, I still spend a lot of my free time playing with frontend web tech to make cool sites I can play with.
          </li>
          <li>
            I've been involved in tutoring in various forms for nearly a decade(!) at this point, and it's shaped so much of my life.
            I started out helping classmates with Java in my highschool's game design class/club, and progressed to SAT, ACT, Physics, Chemistry, Maaaaath, and Coding in college.
            A lot of this work has been private, but I also spent several amazing years as a staff tutor for the Academic Success at Pierce College, and even got the chance to be a speaker at Tutor Expo twice!
          </li>
          <li>
            I was a student at the excellent Pierce College, where I had the opportunity to explore my broad interests all across the earth sciences, math, and philosophy before finally committing to my love of coding at UCLA.
            Along the way, i picked up six(!) associates degrees in Mathematics, Physics, Computer Science, Geology, Philosophy (AA focus), and another Associates in general studies because why not?
            I'm grateful to all the amazing professors who I was able to work so closely with during my time at Pierce, and all the wonderful opportunities I had to give back through teaching my peers.

        <h5>Other stuff and fun facts</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>
            I love rock climbing! While these days I cant get out into the hills as often as I used to, I still climb with the UCLA Climbing team whenever I get the chance. I'm currently pushing v7 boulders, and lead-climbing at a 5.10c
          </li>
          <li>
            I've done a looot of driving for uber eats and grubhub, and I consider myself to be a very good driver as a point of pride.
          </li>
          <li>
            I was once stranded on an island (In a lake, but still)
